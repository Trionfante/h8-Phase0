// 1. Newton's Second Law
    
    // Algorithm
    1. Initiate equation for the Law, which is F equals to m multiplied by a.
    2. Multiply m with a.
    3. Put the result of the multiplication to F.
    4. Print F.

    // Pseudocode
    STORE m
    STORE a
    STORE F
    SET F equals to m multiplied by a
    PRINT F

// 2. Tahun Kabisat

    // Algorithm
    1. Initiate value of Year.
    2. Check if Year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100. If both conditions are true, go to step 4. If not, go to step 3.
    3. Check if Year is divisible by 4, 100 and 400. If is is then go to step 4. If it is not, then go to step 5.
    4. Tell the world that it is a Leap Year.
    5. Tell the world that it is a Common Year.

    //Pseudocode
    STORE year
    IF year MOD 4 EQUALS 0 AND year MOD 100 INEQUALS 0
        PRINT leap
    ELSE IF year MOD 4 EQUALS 0 AND year MOD 100 EQUALS 0 AND year MOD 400 EQUALS 0
        PRINT leap
    ELSE
        PRINT common

// 3. Laundry Day
    
    // Algorithm
    1. Initiate total amount of laundry to wash.
    2. Count the number as you put laundry in until it reach the total amount from step 1.
    3. After the count reach total number of laundry, turn the washing machine.

    //Pseudocode
    STORE total
    STORE count
    WHILE count LESS THAN total
        count PLUS 1
    PRINT done

// 3. Periksa Kuku

    // Algorithm
    1. Initiate total number of student.
    2. Start counting as you check the student.
    3. While the count is not equal to total number, check the next student.
    4. If the nail is short, praise the student. else go to step 5.
    5. Punish the student.

    // Pseudocode
    STORE total
    STORE count
    STORE short
    WHILE count LESS THAN total
        count PLUS 1
        IF short equals TRUE
            PRINT good
        ELSE 
            PRINT bad
    PRINT done
